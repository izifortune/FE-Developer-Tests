#Installation steps

`npm install && bower install` in the root folder.

Since i had problems with your API ( they didn't respond with JSONP but with
JSON ) i made a small proxy based on express. You can see the source code on the
folder proxy.

So before you launch the project go to proxy directory

`npm install` on that directory and launch node bin/www

Now you can launch the app with `grunt serve`

I made a couple of tests too, you can check them in test/spec

For launch the tests hit `grunt test`

You can also checkout the production version with `grunt build`
 and then serve the content of dist directory.
